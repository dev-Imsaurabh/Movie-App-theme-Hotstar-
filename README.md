# Movie-App-theme-Hotstar
This is a basic clone of Disney+Hotstan which I have created using OMDB Api. I have added search feature.
I have used concept of debouncing where I am trying to reduce API calls done by the user during searching any movie and minimizing server cost. 

# Features
Movie searching using OMDB Api
Reducing Api calls using Debouncing concept.
Sorting by ratings
Info about any movie.
